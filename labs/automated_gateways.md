# Lab Name
 Automated-Gateways
# Short Description
Automated Gateways is a secure solution which can make Contract-Call interoperatibility happen between Hyperledger Fabrics with minimal efforts. 

# Scope of Lab
By utilizing three smart contracts as the foundation of authentication and authorization, the Automated Gateways module provides a simple and secure method for Hyperledger fabrics to exchange services and data. When a user integrates this module into their code and deploys three predetermined smart contracts, they can grant access to their services to other Hyperledger fabrics. Moreover, they can access services from smart contracts deployed on other Hyperledger fabrics. Through this method, various Hyperledger fabrics can connect and utilize each other's services.

The module offers users both an API and a CLI. With these tools, users can grant access to their services to other blockchains and invoke services on external blockchains.

This contract-calls interoperability enhances the connectivity of Hyperledger Fabric, reduces the need for reading extensive documentation and protocols from third-party solutions to link different blockchains, and ultimately minimizes service redundancy within the Hyperledger Fabric community.
